# Employee Management System
This project is a web application designed to manage employee information. 

The project uses Razor View Engine with .cshtml files for dynamic content rendering. These views allow the user to manage employee data directly within the web application, including creating, viewing details, updating, and deleting employee records.
The project has multiple views for handling different employee operations and an organized folder structure that suggests a clear separation between employee management pages, home pages, and shared resources.

A robust ASP.NET Core 8 web application integrated with a SQL Server database, creating data models, application context, and efficient database connections. 
CRUD operations performed and utilized Entity Framework for seamless data management. 
Enhanced UX through frontend scaffolding.

Follows a Model-View-Controller (MVC) structure, organizing code into distinct components to handle different responsibilities, improve maintainability, and support dynamic content rendering.

bin and obj folders will be autogenerated
